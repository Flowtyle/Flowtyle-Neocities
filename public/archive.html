    <h2>version 1 - may 24 2024</h2>
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240524155600/https://flowtyle.neocities.org"><img src="images/v1.png" style="border: 1px solid #151519;"></a>
    <p>the very first version of my website. this was heavily inspired by <a href="https://hackerling.space/indexoriginal">hackerling's old layout</a>. 
        yeah it looks like complete ass and i didn't put any time into it but whatever. it was basically just a page for my social links instead of just using a linktree. 
        i did have a guestbook tho! (that never got used)</p>

    <h2>version 2 - december 10 2024</h2>
    <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20241210223828/https://flowtyle.neocities.org/"><img src="images/v2.png" style="border: 1px solid #151519;"></a>
    <p>the revamp of the website! i made it when i was figuring out what to do with my life so i made it in the meantime (as of writing this i still do not know). 
        as u can tell it looks 10000000000x better like the difference is insane. i wanted to go with a bit of a classic look but it doesn't look that old it looks kinda modern i think.
        there are also alot of features with the biggest one being a blog! i was never really into writing but if i have a website i might as well.
         i just included a lot of things that i think would be fun and look cool. also a logo! which i need to remake.</p>
