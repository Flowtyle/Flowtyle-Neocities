<h3>welcome to the new blog!</h3>
<p>i made a blog! this was only possible since switching my site to 11ty which i thought would be complicated but it wasn't too bad. 
    i thought a static site generator would be very complex but it's literally just making a template and adding onto it, then the computer just creates the html files which are just normal html files.</p>
<p>also the reason i chose 11ty was... idk there were tutorials for it and it seems pretty common for neocities users. i don't think it really matters that much</p>
<p>i mainly used a static site generator so i wouldn't have to copy paste the header and footer across hundreds of pages, but it also allowed me to make this blog!
    it was pretty annoying to setup but now that i have it it's pretty much perfect! so now i just type a html file and it'll make a blog post! i can even use all the tags, look!</p>
<p><a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://petrapixel.neocities.org/coding/eleventy-tutorial">this was the tutorial i used to migrate to 11ty...</a></p>
<p><a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://renkotsuban.neocities.org/posts/2023-11-15-Migrating-to-Eleventy">and i also used this for migrating and for making this blog!</a></p>
<p><a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://petrapixel.neocities.org/coding/git-tutorial">im also using deploy to neocities and a github repo</a></p>
<img style="width: 50%" src="../images/cat.jpg" alt="tuxedo cat resting on chair">
<p>look! a cat!</p>
<p> this actually isn't my cat i don't have any pets, this is just a stray that came into my house from a nearby owner (i think). might be bad to let it in but it hasn't been in the living room since.
    i would like to adopt it (or any cat) but again i think someone owns it. could catch it, spray it, and check for a tag but my mum says they have an owner (idk the gender).</p>
<p>there's two other cats aswell, an orange and white one and a smaller calico one. now i dont wanna make assumptions but black + orange + white = calico? and the calico one is smaller? 
    also the orange and white one has a collar but the other two don't... weird.</p>
<p>i would really like a pet. i like dogs more but i would rather live with a cat. i would also like a reptile like a bearded dragon or a ball python but</p>
<ol>
    <li>i dont have money and they're expensive</li>
    <li>no exotic vets</li>
    <li>i live in the uk which is cold so it might be hard to have a warm enclosure! (im shivering right now)</li>
</ol>

<p>look that was a list!</p>
<p>anyway i'll stop yapping now. i have a lot of ideas for the website like goodies and stuff. next blog post will probably be webfishing maybe cause i've been playing dat. ok bye</p>
